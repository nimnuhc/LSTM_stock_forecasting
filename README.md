# LSTM_stock_forecasting
My attempt and forecasting the stock's (S&amp;P500) price and trends from historical data using LSTM models from TensorFlow. I have also experimented the effect of using nomalisation scaling, max-min scaling, and parameters of the model to compare the performance in modelling the stock market.
